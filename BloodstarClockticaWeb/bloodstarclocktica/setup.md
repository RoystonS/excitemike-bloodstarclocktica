# setup

initial setup was done like this:

1. install npm
2. on the command line in project directory:

    1. > `npm init -y`
    2. > `npm install --save-dev typescript rot-js webpack webpack-cli ts-loader live-server npm-run-all`

3. You can then build with `npm run-script webpack` or run the automatic building and development server with `npm run-script watch`
